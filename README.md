# 596 Final Project
Final Project for CSCI 596 Scientific Computing and Visualization

Our project aims visualizes ResNet and ViT analysis to help understand how they work.

# Problem
ResNet and ViT analysis are deep learning algorithms used to identify and classify images.
However, it can be difficult to determine what the deep learning algorithm is actually doing.

# Methods
Visualizing the ResNet feature maps and ViT analysis attention maps helps us understand what is actually happening.
By performing feature extraction, we can get the feature maps ResNet uses and the attention map layers from ViT analysis.
Turning the results into heat maps can help us determine what is actually happening.

# Results
We made a simple tool with several options to analyze and visualize the processes ResNet and ViT analysis go through.
Using this tool, we can overlay a selected feature map and attention map layer to visualize where a particular feature map is looking, helping us determine what the feature map is looking for.
